{"name":"HomeFront Router Project","tagline":"Got your own BPI-R1 hardware?  This is what you need next...","body":"### So here is the idea:  \r\nAn open-source router plus a server-based Control Center designed to automate EVERYTHING humanly possible in the residential space that will assist the family IT \"fixer\". What is now possible is Fan-Friggin-Tastic compared to just a few years ago.  \r\n\r\n### A glimpse of what we have in mind:\r\n* Open Source Software\r\n* Local and Centralized control consoles\r\n* Offsite configuration storage and sync\r\n* 24/7 monitoring of network inventories\r\n* Integrated B/G/N WiFi Access Point!\r\n* Automated workstation imaging/backups\r\n* DNS based Safe Surfing filter\r\n* Transparent HTTP proxy with Malware scanner\r\n* Drop dead simple VPN:\r\n** for secure remote assistance using VNC, SSH, etc.\r\n** Mesh VPN for connecting households for:\r\n*** direct file sharing, gaming, video cams. free Long Distance SIP \"bat phones\", etc.\r\n* MAC address monitoring (alerts when new devices are plugged in, or on WiFi)\r\n* Open Source Hardware too!\r\n* Plus the ability to offer add-on services:\r\n** Enterprise Anti-Virus subscriptions (forget Best Buy markup)\r\n** Offsite backup from companies we like, like tarsnap.com\r\n** Secure routes to anonymizing services\r\n** paid Ad Block service for entire networks\r\n** You tell us!\r\n\r\nPhase 2 is targeted at the mom&pop computer shops already in the trenches with us.\r\n\r\nAs we figure exactly how we are going to pull this off, feel free to let us know what would REALLY help you support those you do, and make their computer lives smoother.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
